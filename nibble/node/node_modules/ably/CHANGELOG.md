[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/compare/0.8.22...0.8.23)

**Biggest changes:**

## [0.8.22](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/tree/0.8.22) (2016-06-24)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/compare/0.8.21...0.8.22)

**Biggest changes:**

- Log and emit errors that occur on-connect (resume failures and upgrade failures) [\#291](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/291)

- Rework upgrade flow so that all messages complete on one transport before switching to another, to avoid 'Invalid transport ID' message race condition [\#291](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/291)

- Fix issue [\#285](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/issues/285) where a detach that happens during a presence sync could fail (also [\#291](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/291))

- Log all connectionDetails on transport active (including the server you're connected to), not just clientId [\#294](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/294)

- Implement `waitForSync` option in (realtime form of) `presence.get()` [\#295](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/295)

## [0.8.21](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/tree/0.8.21) (2016-06-21)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/compare/0.8.20...0.8.21)

**Biggest changes:**

- Fix bug where comet transports would occasionally send messages out of order if the sending rate is very high [\#290](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/290)

## [0.8.20](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/tree/0.8.20) (2016-06-13)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/compare/0.8.19...0.8.20)

**Biggest changes:**

- Rewrite the transport fallback sequence. It now starts with a polling transport (since some proxies break streaming transports) and then tries to upgrade to a websocket and streaming transport in parallel, picking the websocket if possible. It also remembers the best transport that worked (using HTML5 localstorage) and jumps straight to that if it can. [\#279](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/279)

- Fix crypto bug when generating random data in IE 8 and 9 [\#282](https://github.com/ably/ably-js/pull/282)
